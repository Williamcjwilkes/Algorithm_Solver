#### this is a small program that will be used to help my understanding of sorting algorithms. the program will implement these sorting algorithms: 
    - Bubble Sort 
    - Merge Sort 
#### please be sure to check back as i will be adding more throughout the cycle. 

## how the program works 
#### run the program from a terminal (a visual implementation will be coming eventually) however at present the program will and should be run from the terminal.

#### run main.py with the following arguments, ```input output algorithm```
###EXAMPLE
```pathtofile/main.py input\_file output\_file Merge```

#### this will return a sorted list of integers to the output file with handy infomation. 

### EXAMPLE 
#### Terminal commands run:

#### The Algorithm Program Bubble Edition
```Algorithm_Solver/main.py Algorithm_Solver/input.txt Algorithm_Solver/output.txt Bubble```

#### The filepath for the input is: ```Algorithm_Solver/input.txt
The filepath for the output is: Algorithm_Solver/output.txt ```
#### The algorithm selected was:
> Bubble

 ##### The unsorted array is:
> 2 3 4 5 93 324 12 53 666 77 324 2 34 11 1 2 6 3 7 4 6 5 8 7 6 7 8 9 99 97 45 67 23 87 22 

 ##### The sorted array is:
> 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 7 8 8 9 11 12 22 23 34 45 53 67 77 87 93 97 99 324 324 666
